SW Skills 4 Testing Lab - Theophilus Braimoh - 02/28/023

This repo is a lab that makes use of pytest and makefiles. The tests are primarily whitebox but serve an important purpose in learning how to use makefiles to call on them. I learned the importance of debugging and how to use pytest decorators more effectively.
